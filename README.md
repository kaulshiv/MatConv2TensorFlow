# MatConv2TensorFlow
Port a MatConvNet trained model to TensorFlow (python) model. 

## IMPORTANT: 
These 2 files are not intended to be universally runable out of the box, they are only intended to serve as a starting point. I only added the important parts I was interested in - layer weights/biases, softmax, learning rates, etc. If you look at the datastructure created by matconvnet, you can extend the code for yourself. 


## Files:
This is performed in 2 stages: scrape the matconvnet to make a 

 * **MatLab2Python.py**: Run this first to make a model.p pickle file. You just need to make sure the "net.mat" string matches the name/path to your matconvnet mat file at the bottom of the file. This pulls a python dictionary from the matconvnet model, and then creates a human readable model representation - which is a list of dictionaries for the layers. 
 
  * **Conv2TF-Slim.py**: this is the specific Tensorflow Model using TF-Slim. It REALLY should only be used for reference in creating your own models. It loads the pickle file generated in the previous file, and creates a basic tensorflow CNN model. To Use: you must update the input size at the top - and adjust the number of layers accordingly.
 


## DISCLAIMERS
 * I make no gaurentees about preserving accuracies. I currently am working with unlabelled data. Visually the results appear consistent between MatConvNet and Tensorflow, however I have not compared accuracies. 
 * This was a quick and dirty implementation, I am aware there are more efficient ways to perform this function. My use case, I simply needed the ability to obtain predictions, and the network is very small, allowing a lot of manual coding. 
 
 **PLEASE** If you use this for your own code, consider sharing your edits if they make it more robust.
